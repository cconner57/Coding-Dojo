#1. Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new list that counts down by one, from number (as the 0th element) down to 0(as the last element)
#Answer:
 def countdown ():
     x = []
     for i in range(countdown, 0, -1):
         print(i)

#2. Create a function that will receive a list with two numbers. Print the first value and return the second
#Answer:
def p_and_r (x, y):
    print(x)
    return(y)

#3. Create a function that accepts a list and returns the sum of the first value in the list plus the list's length
#Answer:
def f_plus_l (list):
    sum = list[0] + len(list)
    return sum

#4. Write a function that accepts a list and creats a new list containing only the values from the original list that are greater than its 2nd value. Print how many values this is and then return the new list. If the list has less than 2 elements, have the function return False
#Answer:
def val_gre_sec (list):
    x = []
    for i in range(list[1], len(list[i]), 1)
        if list[i] < list[1]
            x.push
            print(x)
        else:
            len(list) < 2
            return "False"

#5. Write a function that accepts two integers as parameters: size and value. The function should create and return a list whose length is equal to the given size, and whose values are all the given value.
#Answer:
def this_len_that_val (size, value):
    x = []
    len(x) = size
    for i in range(value, len(x)):
        x[value]
